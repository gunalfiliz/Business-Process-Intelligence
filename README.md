## First Project: Optimization of Loan Application Process

### Project Context

As a key component of the Business Process Intelligence course at RWTH Aachen University, our project, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Ir. Wil van der Aalst, was to analyze and optimize the loan application process of a major German bank. The project was an intensive application of theoretical concepts to a real-world dataset, focusing on data-driven process improvement.

### Objective
Our main goal was to dissect and enhance the bank's loan application process using process mining and predictive analytics. This included identifying bottlenecks, predicting loan application outcomes, and understanding customer behaviour patterns to improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### **Duration**

The project lasted several months and included data preparation, predictive modelling, clustering applications and process analysis.

### **Tools and Methodologies**

We employed RapidMiner and Celonis for our analysis, which involved:

- **Data Preparation and Analysis:** We combined event logs of the loan application process into a comprehensive situation table that enabled us to conduct a detailed analysis.
- **Predictive Modelling:** Using decision trees, we built a predictive model to ascertain the outcome of loan applications. This model helped us understand key factors influencing the decision process and boasted an impressive accuracy of about 90%.
- **Clustering Applications:** We segmented loan applications into clusters to discern patterns across different loan types and customer behaviours, utilizing k-means clustering.
- **Process Analysis:** We mapped and reviewed the application process in Celonis, identifying critical areas for process acceleration, particularly for applications taking longer than 30 days.

### Key Findings and Impact

Our comprehensive analysis led to several actionable insights:

- **Predictive Accuracy:** Our decision tree model significantly decoded the factors leading to successful loan completions, highlighting the critical role of credit scores and throughput times.
- **Process Efficiency:** We pinpointed specific process steps, such as application validation, where delays were most pronounced, suggesting improvements that could reduce cycle times and improve customer response rates.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustering revealed distinct groups of applications that could be targeted differently to optimize processing times and customer service strategies.

### Conclusion

This project significantly honed our skills in data analysis and process optimization. We submitted our comprehensive report, which details our methods and findings. Our work was well-received, earning a score of 96 out of 100, reflecting the high quality and applicability of our analysis.

## Second Project: Optimizing Ticket Management

### Project Context

As a key component of the Business Process Intelligence course at RWTH Aachen University, our project, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Ir. Wil van der Aalst, focused on enhancing the ticket management system of an Italian software company catering to small and medium-sized food businesses. This endeavour represented a practical application of our course theories to a complex, real-world dataset aimed at optimizing and streamlining the customer service process.

### Objective

Our objective is to enhance the understanding and analysis of business process intelligence by exploring various aspects such as event log properties, process discovery, conformance checking, decision mining, and performance evaluation. Through detailed examination and interpretation of the provided data, we aim to derive valuable insights that can inform decision-making and process optimization strategies.

### **Duration**

The analysis was conducted over several weeks, involving phases of data exploration, process modeling, resource allocation analysis, predictive analysis and organizational mining.

### **Analytical Techniques and Tools Used**

The project utilized a variety of advanced analytical tools and methodologies:

- **ProM** and **Celonis** for process mining to explore and analyze the event logs.
- **RapidMiner** for data mining tasks such as decision tree analysis and clustering.
- The analysis involved investigating the nature of event logs, understanding process variations, checking model conformance, and deriving insights from data-driven process analysis.

### **Data and Methodology**

The data consisted of event logs from a trouble ticketing system used by the software company. These logs record various activities involved in handling customer service requests related to software issues and tracking the start, resolution, and closure of each ticket.

- **Event Log Analysis**: Initial processing to identify key characteristics of the logs such as total cases, events, activities, and trace variants.
- **Process Discovery**: Application of several process mining algorithms to discover models that accurately represent the underlying processes.
- **Conformance Checking**: Evaluation of how well the discovered process models conform to the actual events logged.
- **Decision Mining and Performance Analysis**: Using data mining techniques to predict outcomes and analyze the performance based on the real-time processing of tickets.

### **Conclusion**

Our analysis effectively streamlined operational processes by identifying and suggesting the elimination of redundant activities. We provided insights on adapting processes to minimize disruption during software updates. Through detailed conformance checking, discrepancies between expected and actual process executions were pinpointed, enabling targeted improvements. Our decision mining approach clarified behavioral patterns associated with specific ticket types and resource allocations, informing better management strategies. Overall, the project significantly enhanced operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
